# My Personal Workspace
This project is designed for my personal specific use-cases. There are a variety of applications within this project from a simple to-do list from viewing my GitHub analytics (commits, deployments, etc.).

## The purpose
The whole objective of this project was to organize my personal life as well as my programming venture. Secondly, I knew this project was going to involve more complicated APIs / libraries. I wanted to push my knowledge and capabilities by incorporating these complexities.
